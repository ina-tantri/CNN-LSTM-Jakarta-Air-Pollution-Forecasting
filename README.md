# CNN-LSTM-Jakarta-Air-Pollution-Forecasting
Time series forecasting using CNN-LSTM to predict air pollution (PM10) in Jakarta. The CNN components are used to capture the spatial effects by using different stations simultaneously, while the LSTM is used to accommodate the temporal variations.

The data was collected daily from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2021, at 5 Air Quality Monitoring Stations in Jakarta.

Forecasting is based solely on historical data, without additional variables. Each forecast resulting in total of 5 forecasts across all stations.
